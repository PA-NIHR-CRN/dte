## Project's Title
**Volunteer Service**: A React-based platform for connecting volunteers with research opportunities.

## Project Description
Volunteer Service is a React application designed to help users register with "Be Part of Research" and discover research opportunities tailored to their interests. The main goal of this project is to streamline the registration process and facilitate connections between volunteers and relevant research projects.

The application was developed using React due to its flexibility, scalability, and maintainability. React allows for the creation of reusable components, improving the overall development experience and making future updates easier to implement. Some challenges faced during the development process included handling user authentication and maintaining a responsive user interface. Future features to be implemented include MFA and integration with additional authentication providers.
